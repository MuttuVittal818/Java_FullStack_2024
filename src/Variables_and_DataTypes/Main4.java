/*  Instance Variable
    Instance variables are those which are declared inside the body of a class but not within any methods.
    These differ with each instance of the class created although they have the same identity.
    It is called instance variable because its value is instance specific and is not shared among instances.
    Itâ€™s default value is zero.
    Syntax: <data_type> <variable_name>;
